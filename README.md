# odin-recipes
Today I will be building a basic recipe website. This project is a rehashing of everything I've learned about shell commands, terminal, HTML, and Git thus far. 
The skills that I will be demonstrating are creating a repo on Github, cloning the repository to my local machine, staging commits, committing, and pushing those commits to Github. Additionally, I will showcase my knowledge of the <a> anchor tag and href attribute, creating ordered lists and unordered lists, the <img> tag and the src and rel attributes, etc.
